# `zotero-bridge workflow describe`

Describe workflow selection and workflow options

## Usage

```console
zotero-bridge workflow describe [--endpoint <ENDPOINT>] [--operation-id <ID>] [--profile <PATH>] [--schema] --workflow <WORKFLOW> [--workflow-options <JSON_OR_FILE>]
```

The global options may appear before or after the leaf command. Use `--schema` to inspect raw structured-input schemas without loading a profile or connecting to Zotero.

## Global parameters

| Token | Id | Kind | Required | Conditional requirement | Values / arity | Repeatable | Environment | Conflicts | Help |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --endpoint | endpoint | option | no | — | ENDPOINT | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT | — | Zotero Bridge service endpoint base URL. If omitted, the CLI reads ZOTERO_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT or a profile file. The CLI does not guess random bridge ports. |
| --operation-id | operation_id | option | no | — | ID | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_OPERATION_ID | — | Opaque idempotency id for a state-changing Zotero request |
| --profile | profile | option | no | — | PATH | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_PROFILE | — | Path to a Zotero Bridge connection-profile JSON file. If omitted, the CLI tries the Zotero Agents well-known profile. ACP run profiles usually reference tokenEnv; the local well-known profile may contain a bearer token protected by user-level file permissions. |
| --schema | schema | option | no | — | SCHEMA; values: true, false | no | — | — | Print the versioned raw JSON Schemas and governed examples for one canonical leaf command. Schema mode is offline and does not load a profile, read Zotero Bridge configuration, or connect to Zotero. |

## Local options and positionals

| Token | Id | Kind | Required | Conditional requirement | Values / arity | Repeatable | Environment | Conflicts | Help |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --workflow | workflow | option | yes | — | WORKFLOW | no | — | — | Workflow id to describe |
| --workflow-options | workflow_options | option | no | — | JSON_OR_FILE | no | — | — | Draft workflow options JSON object, file path, @file, or '-' for stdin |

## Invocation schema

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "workflow": {
      "description": "Workflow id to describe",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "workflow-options": {
      "description": "Draft workflow options JSON object, file path, @file, or '-' for stdin",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "workflow"
  ],
  "type": "object"
}
```

## Structured input schemas

### `--workflow-options` (workflow_options)

Required: `false`.

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": true,
  "description": "Workflow-declared option values are intentionally open and are validated by the selected workflow.",
  "type": "object",
  "x-openPropertiesReason": "The selected workflow manifest owns its option vocabulary."
}
```

## Composed payload schema

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "workflow": {
      "description": "Workflow id to describe",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "workflow_options": {
      "description": "Draft workflow options JSON object, file path, @file, or '-' for stdin",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [],
  "type": "object"
}
```

## Payload composition

This command has no separate field-mapping program. Its binding mode is executable directly: passthrough uses the sole structured source, while `none` and `raw` retain their declared closed behavior.

`composition`: `null`.

## Result schema

```json
{
  "additionalProperties": true,
  "properties": {
    "response": {
      "additionalProperties": true,
      "description": "Response object returned by POST /bridge/v2/workflows/describe.",
      "type": "object",
      "x-openPropertiesReason": "The mapped local endpoint or service owns fields inside response; the command envelope is closed."
    }
  },
  "type": "object",
  "x-openPropertiesReason": "The local endpoint returns a command-specific object whose extension fields are preserved explicitly."
}
```

## Examples

### workflow_options: shape-only

Minimal JSON shape for --workflow-options.

```console
zotero-bridge workflow describe --workflow-options '{}'
```

Prerequisites:

- Replace example identifiers and values with inputs valid for the selected Zotero library, workflow, provider, or capability before execution.

## Complete command descriptor

This closed descriptor is the machine-readable command contract returned by `surface describe`; it is included here so the card remains independently auditable without loading another command reference.

## Parameter failure and recovery contract

Parameter failures are returned as one JSON error envelope. Inspect `error.code`, then require `error.details.schema` to be `host-bridge.argument-error.v1` before using the structured boundary fields. Preserve the canonical command, sanitized inputs, and any already-returned typed handles; never include the complete raw payload in evidence.

- `argv` reports a missing, unknown, conflicting, or invalid CLI argument. Rebuild argv from this card's parameter tables or the active command help.
- `json_source` reports an unreadable stdin or file source. Correct that source without moving the value to a different binding.
- `json_syntax` reports invalid JSON with safe line and column context. Repair syntax before interpreting domain fields.
- `command_input` reports schema violations for a structured input. Inspect the bounded `violations`, then run this exact leaf with `--schema` and correct the declared field or type; do not invent an alias.
- `payload_contract` means the CLI's composed capability payload violates the executable contract before network I/O. Treat this as an implementation fault; do not bypass the semantic command with raw transport.
- `command_result` means a Host response or local result failed its executable result schema. Do not accept or report it as successful evidence.
- Violation arrays are redacted, deterministically ordered, and capped at eight. When `truncated` is true, correct the reported violations and validate again rather than requesting secret or complete payload disclosure.

## Operational contract

- Canonical argv path: `workflow` `describe`.
- Output boundary: `fixed`; governed details: {"strategy":"fixed"}.
- Pagination: `none`.
- Category: `read`; danger: `none`.
- Structured binding mode: `overlay`.
- Intent visibility: `visible`.
- Operational aliases: `workflow describe`, `workflow`, `describe`, `WORKFLOW`, `workflow_options`, `workflow-options`, `JSON_OR_FILE`.
