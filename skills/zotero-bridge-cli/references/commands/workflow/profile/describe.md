# `zotero-bridge workflow profile describe`

Describe the provider profile contract for one backend

## Usage

```console
zotero-bridge workflow profile describe [--endpoint <ENDPOINT>] [--operation-id <ID>] [--profile <PATH>] [--schema] --backend <BACKEND>
```

The global options may appear before or after the leaf command. This leaf has no structured JSON input. `--schema` returns `command_input_schema_unavailable`; use command help or `surface describe` to inspect the invocation contract.

## Global parameters

| Token | Id | Kind | Required | Conditional requirement | Values / arity | Repeatable | Environment | Conflicts | Help |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --endpoint | endpoint | option | no | — | ENDPOINT | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT | — | Zotero Bridge service endpoint base URL. If omitted, the CLI reads ZOTERO_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT or a profile file. The CLI does not guess random bridge ports. |
| --operation-id | operation_id | option | no | — | ID | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_OPERATION_ID | — | Opaque idempotency id for a state-changing Zotero request |
| --profile | profile | option | no | — | PATH | no | ZOTERO_BRIDGE_PROFILE | — | Path to a Zotero Bridge connection-profile JSON file. If omitted, the CLI tries the Zotero Agents well-known profile. ACP run profiles usually reference tokenEnv; the local well-known profile may contain a bearer token protected by user-level file permissions. |
| --schema | schema | option | no | — | SCHEMA; values: true, false | no | — | — | Print the versioned raw JSON Schemas and governed examples for one canonical leaf command. Schema mode is offline and does not load a profile, read Zotero Bridge configuration, or connect to Zotero. |

## Local options and positionals

| Token | Id | Kind | Required | Conditional requirement | Values / arity | Repeatable | Environment | Conflicts | Help |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --backend | backend | option | yes | — | BACKEND | no | — | — | Configured backend id whose provider profile is described |

## Invocation schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "backend": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Configured backend id whose provider profile is described"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "backend"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Structured input schemas

This command has no structured JSON input parameter.

## Composed payload schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "backend": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Configured backend id whose provider profile is described"
    }
  },
  "required": [],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Result schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "response": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Response object returned by POST /bridge/v1/workflows/provider-profiles/describe.",
      "additionalProperties": true,
      "x-openPropertiesReason": "The mapped local endpoint or service owns fields inside response; the command envelope is closed."
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": true,
  "x-openPropertiesReason": "The local endpoint returns a command-specific object whose extension fields are preserved explicitly."
}
```

## Examples

No structured-input example applies. Build argv from the parameter tables and confirm the command with `surface describe` before execution.

## Complete command descriptor

This closed descriptor is the machine-readable command contract returned by `surface describe`; it is included here so the card remains independently auditable without loading another command reference.
